    <td>Technology has had a huge impact on all our daily lives, from social media to work we look at where the impact is: <br>
    <br>
 Technology affects almost every aspect of 21st century life, from transport efficiency and safety to access to food and healthcare, socialization and productivity. The power of the internet has enabled global communities to form, and ideas and resources to be shared more easily. However, the overuse of some technology has been linked to a decline in mental health, increased social division and privacy concerns.

We take technology for granted every day even when itâ€™s delivering us the latest news in an instant, making our cappuccino, or connecting us with a loved one halfway across the country (or even the world).  <br>
<br>
Ways Technology Impacts Our Lives:<br>
Improved Communication<br>
Decreased Privacy<br>
Accessible Shopping<br>
Better Information Access<br>
Virtual Social Lives<br>
Flexible Working<br>
Smarter Health Tracking<br>
<br>
So, there we have it seven dramatic ways that technology has impacted our daily lives for good. Of course, technology never takes a rest, and you can bet that it will not be long before some of the devices and services we have covered here are superseded in many cases, their next iteration is already being worked on in a lab somewhere.
