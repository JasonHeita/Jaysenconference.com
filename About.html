<h2>DEFINITION OF TECNOLOGY FOR HUMANITY</h2>
<h1>There has always been a gap between those people and communities who can make effective use of information technology and those who cannot. Now, more than ever, unequal adoption of technology excludes many from reaping the fruits of the economy.

We use the term "digital divide" to refer to this gap between those who can effectively use new information and communication tools, such as the Internet, and those who cannot. While a consensus does not exist on the extent of the divide (and whether the divide is growing or narrowing), researchers are nearly unanimous in acknowledging that some sort of divide exists at this point in time. We focus on minorities and people with disabilities, and we also occasionally help seniors and veterans.

    <h2>Technology interacting with humans</h2>
   <h1>Technology has helped to modify human behavior by creating a gap between people and reducing intimacy.<br> 
    In an age where robots and AI are slowly replacing humans within the workplace, <br>
    this interaction between humans and machines is only set to increase. <br>

      <h2>Humans interacting with Technology</h2>
      <h1>Today, people interact with technology through ever more intelligent interfaces, moving from traditional keyboards to touchscreens, voice commands, and beyond. And even these engagement patterns are giving way to new and more seamless and natural methods of interaction.
